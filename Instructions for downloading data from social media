**Instructions for downloading data from Twitter/X and Facebook:**

To download tweets from Twitter/X for language modeling research, you can use Twitter/X's API (Application Programming Interface). Here are the general steps you need to follow:

**Create a Twitter/X Developer Account:**

- Go to the Twitter/X Developer website and sign in with your Twitter/X account.
- Create a developer account and create a new app. This will provide you with API keys and access tokens.

**Set Up Your Twitter/X App:**

- Once your app is created, navigate to the "Keys and Tokens" tab to get your API key, API secret key, Access token, and Access token secret.

**Install Tweepy (Python Library for Twitter/X API):**

- You can use the Tweepy library in Python to interact with the Twitter/X API. Install it using:

**Use Tweepy to Download Tweets:**

- Use the following code snippet as a starting point. Replace the placeholders with your actual API keys and tokens.
- Below is an example search for tweets containing the specified keyword ('language modeling') and saves them to a JSON file.

**Adhere to Twitter/X API Rate Limits:**

- Be mindful of Twitter/X's API rate limits. Make sure your application does not exceed these limits to avoid temporary suspensions.

**Preprocess and Clean Data:**

- Depending on your research goals, you might need to preprocess and clean the downloaded tweets before using them for language modeling.

To download status updates from Facebook for language modeling research. Here are the general steps you need to follow:

**Create a Facebook App and Obtain Access Token:**

- Go to the [Facebook Developer Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/) and create a new app.
- Once created, obtain an access token with the necessary permissions. For reading posts, you usually need the user_posts permission for personal profiles or read_insights for pages.

**Use Graph API to Fetch Posts:**

- Construct API requests to fetch posts from profiles or pages. The endpoint for fetching posts typically looks like:
- <https://graph.facebook.com/{user-id> or page-id}/posts
- Replace {user-id or page-id} with the ID of the profile or page you want to fetch posts from.

**Handling Data:**

- The response will be in JSON format. Extract and store the data as needed for your research.

**Compliance and Ethical Considerations:**

- Ensure you comply with Facebook's Platform Policies and any legal or ethical guidelines regarding data usage and privacy.
